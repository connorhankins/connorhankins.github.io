<h2><u> Radio/Podcasting</u></h2>
<ul>
<li>I have been involved in radio since my freshman year of highschool where I started at my school's radio station WLTL <a href="wltl.net">(WLTL.net)</a>. In high school, I was the Sports Director for the station where I oversaw three sports-talk shows, broadcasted a variety of sports and hosted a weekly sports-talk program. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience and appreciated the management opportunity where I interviewed many candidates and formed a sports department of approximately 20 students.</h2>
        </li>
<li>My senior year of high school, I created a business talk program that aired on my high school radio station. The show discussed local and global business news, analyzed the stock market and interview business leaders such as accounting/economics teachers, an investment bank professors and business professionals in various industries. The show was a finalist for "Best High School Specialty Program" at the IBS National Radio Awards.</li>
<li>I joined my college radio station, WIUX, my freshman year where I quickly got involved with the sports department. I ended up hosting numerous sports-talk programs throughout my time in college.</li>
<li> During my first rotation in the Finance Rotation Program, myself and a colleague created the "FRP Podcast". The podcast allows members of the program to talk about their experience, hobbies, and advice for people who are new to the program. </li>
</ul>
    
    
<h2><u> Sports</u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>For as long as I can remember, sports have been an integral part of my life. Growing up, I played just about every sport that you can think of and developed passions for baseball, basketball, football, and volleyball in particular. In High school, I played on my school's volleyball team every year, including two years on the varsity team. After being one game away from the state tournament my Junior year, my teammates and I worked hard to make our senior year one to remember. As a result, we made it to the state finals tournament my senior year. </li>
    
    <li>I've learned countless lessons from sports throughout the years, especially regarding the value of teamwork, dedication and perseverance. One of my favorite sports quotes was one that my dad put on my wall when I was a kid, which came from Derek Jeter: "There may be people that have more talent than you, but there's no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do - and I believe that". I try to live by this quote not only when playing sports but also have applied it to school and my career. </li>
</ul>



<h2><u> Hiking</u></h2>
    

<ul>
    <li>Hiking is a newer passion of mine but it has quickly become something I thoroughly enjoy. Growing up in the Midwest near Chicago, hiking and exploring terrain wasn't necessarily something myself nor my friends got the chance to do too often. However, after spending time in the Pacific Northwest for my Microsoft internship in Summer 2019, I quickly fell in love with the amazing nature out there. My friends/co-workers would go hiking at least once every week and I got to truly immerse myself into the fantastic Washington hiking culture. </li>
    <li>Some of my favorite hikes include: Lake 22 (Seattle), Tolmie Peak (Seattle), Rattlesnake Ledge (Seattle), Oregon Dunes (Western Oregon), Sedona (Arizona) </li>
